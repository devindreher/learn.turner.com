<h3 class="q">After sending a resume to a hiring manager via email, would it be OK to follow up by calling the hiring manager if there is no initial reply to the email?</h3>

<div class="answer-row">
    <div class="answer-name">
        <p><b>Andrew Carlson:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>If you have a solid understanding of the open role, the department, the duties, and what the hiring manager is looking for, I'd absolutely recommend reaching out to express your interest in interviewing for the position.</p>
        <p>Many hiring managers like to see candidates show their enthusiasm and ambition by applying and making their interest known as soon as the job is posting. If you are any way unsure about what the job is or what the team is looking for, I'd recommend reaching out to the equivalent recruiter to ask for context first. You want to be sure to put your best foot forward when either interviewing or reaching out to a hiring manager and a recruiter can give you all sorts of helpful tips for how to do so.</p>
        <p>A heads up, though: just because a position has been posted online doesn't mean the recruiter has had her or his kickoff conversation with the hiring team yet to discuss the details of the role. With that, depending on how quickly you reach out, the recruiter may not be able to provide you with the context you're looking for just yet.</p>
        <p>Lastly, if the hiring manager isn't quick to respond to your email, have no fear &mdash; although they may have appreciated receiving your message, some hiring managers will defer to the recruiter to address your candidacy.</p>

<h3 class="q">What is the importance of sending a cover letter along with a resume? What should a cover letter include?</h3>

<div class="answer-row">
    <div class="answer-name">
        <p><b>Fabienne Lauture:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>So how 'bout we change the purpose of the cover letter? Use the cover letter as an opportunity to pitch yourself. Your resume is one document that illustrates where you have been applying your knowledge and expertise. But, it may not have the nuance or color needed to provide insight into your motivation for this opportunity &mdash; it may not highlight that you are a self-taught coder or that you took two years off to raise your family and launched a successful blog. Use that space to pitch yourself with purpose. Infuse your personality and state the case for what makes you a stand out hire.</p>
        <p>Also, be mindful of typos. Read it backwards to catch errors.</p>

<h3 class="q">How do you recommend applying for jobs if you are in a contract role (e.g., an apprentice)?</h3>

<div class="answer-row">
    <div class="answer-name">
        <p><b>Annie Scagel:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>If you're qualified for an open role, it's best practice to apply to openings after a couple of months in your position at Turner. If you have a contract end date, it's important to keep that in mind when you apply to openings and be transparent about your end date with recruiters and hiring managers.</p>
        <p>As for apprenticeships, the apprentice should apply when they are close to completing the program. Best practice is 3-4 months before the end date. It's key that the apprentice keeps their commitment to the program.</p>

<h3 class="q">Do you take more notice of visually creative resumes?</h3>

<div class="answer-row">
    <div class="answer-name">
        <p><b>Kevin Harry:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes, we do &mdash; especially for creative positions. Just be mindful that the "creativity" doesn't take over the content.</p>

<h3 class="q">Do you have any tips on how to connect/introduce yourself to the recruiter for the department you're interested in?</h3>

<div class="answer-row">
    <div class="answer-name">
        <p><b>Andrew Carlson:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>When reaching out to a recruiter, be sure to be clear in your initial message what sort of help you need exactly. Depending on what you are looking for, they may be able to set you up for informational interviews, give you context on positions opening soon that you might be interested in, or potentially even connect you with a different recruiter or HR Business Partner.</p>
        <p>Also, if you're setting up time to talk to a recruiter, giving them explicit information up front will allow them time to gather pertinent information in preparation for the conversation. For example, if you're looking for help regarding an open position, be sure to let the recruiter know the job number, title, and (if you're applying to the role), a PDF copy of your resume.</p>

<h3 class="q">How often do you work with our sister companies, HBO and Warner Bros.? How do I get more information on jobs at those companies and what does transferring look like?</h3>


<div class="answer-row">
    <div class="answer-name">
        <p><b>Annie Scagel:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Our team works with our sister companies on occasion. We network with them as needed if we have roles based in their demographics.</p>
        <p>Transferring to either HBO or Warner Bros. isn't a one size fits all situation &mdash; it could be a relocation, demographic, or just an organization switch. We aim to make this a fairly seamless process. Once you apply to the role and are contacted by a recruiter, we'll get you involved in the interview process. If you receive an offer, you must make your current manager aware of it and talk through a start date. Your new manager will contact your current manager and confirm it. Lastly, HR will make the offer detail changes in our systems to move you into the new role.</p>
        <p>To get more information on openings at HBO and Warner Bros., visit their career page or set a job alert: <a href="http://www.timewarner.com/careers" target="_blank">www.timewarner.com/careers</a>.</p>

<h3 class="q">Do you look at the number of jobs a candidate has applied for? Does that record reset after a certain amount of time?</h3>

<div class="answer-row">
    <div class="answer-name">
        <p><b>Fabienne Lauture:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>We see everything! We see typos, we see that you repurposed the same cover letter for a different job, and we see that you applied for 100 or more jobs. What's important to remember is that we are on your side! If your goal is to work in marketing and you've applied to every marketing job opening then we can see your line of sight. But, let's be honest here: when you apply to every hot job from managing editor to research analyst, then legal assistant and vice president of fun applications, you might get a pause and side eye as we try to understand your intentions. Stay focused.</p>

<h3 class="q">Is there a resume format/layout that works best for the screening process?</h3>

<div class="answer-row">
    <div class="answer-name">
        <p><b>Andrew Carlson:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>There is no one size fits all resume layout, but the best ones all have the same two qualities: they're easy to read and they draw clear lines from the candidates' capabilities to the job qualifications. My suggestion is to build out your resume and share it with a friend. Ask them to quickly skim your resume. Then ask them two questions: 1) What capabilities do you think I was trying to show off in this resume? 2) What type of role do you think I'm applying to? If they didn't come close with either answer, rewrite and reformat until your resume gives your intended first impression.</p>

<h3 class="q">There are instances were internal candidates do not get a response from Recruiting. How do you follow up to get feedback without being stalkerish?</h3>

<div class="answer-row">

    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Our goal is to respond to all emails, especially ones from internal candidates but, unfortunately, it happens. I often find a simple email inquiry to the recruiter to be the most helpful. Quite often there are details on the status of the job you are not aware of.</p>

<h3 class="q">How do you get a recruiter to recognize you as a viable candidate for a Turner job?</h3>

<div class="answer-row">
    <div class="answer-name">
        <p><b>Fabienne Lauture:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Genuine self-awareness: <i>hey, recruiter! I really want to grow here at Turner, but I don't know what my next move is.</i></p>
        <p>Be honest with yourself and recognize what you can do and what you need to learn. Do some homework on the career or department. When the direction is given, follow through. The recruiter is one of many relationships that can support your career goals. Think of your manager, peers, key clients, and employees in the role that you want. All have unique insights into how to get to the next level.</p>
        <p>Remember: be positive and everything will work out!</p>

<h3 class="q">In addition to your resume, do you see other documents as equally as important to help you stand out? (E.g., portfolio, writing samples, etc.)</h3>

        <p><b>Kevin Harry:</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Absolutely! Cover letters are always nice and having a solid, up-to-date portfolio helps you stand out from the rest of the pack. Some things to think about when including in your application or follow-up emails are links to reels, any writing sample such as a blog or article you've written, your professional web sites, or even social media posts if those are relevant to the role.</p>
