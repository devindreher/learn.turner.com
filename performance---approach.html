<h2>Our Approach to Performance</h2>

<!-- main-content -->

<div class="content-wrapper">
    
    <p><b>Performance is about the conversation.</b></p>
    <p>The work we do over the course of a year (or career, for that matter) is a narrative that can &mdash; and should &mdash; have meaning. You'll notice that we don't use a rating scale. Instead of focusing on a number, we provide flexibility to bring the full dimension of our contributions into frequent conversations with your manager.</p>

    <p><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>
    <p class="faq"><b>Are there guidelines for how often to have conversations?</b></p>
    <p class="faq">In addition to the more formal conversations that occur at the beginning, middle, and end of the year, managers and their direct reports should work together to determine the ideal approach for how often to have informal, one-on-one conversations. For some it may be weekly. For others, bi-weekly or maybe even monthly (at the very least).
    <br><br>
    Everyone (whether they're people leaders or not) should be empowered to initiate feedback conversations if you want -- either formally or informally.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p class="faq"><b>How do managers justify promotions without having a numeric rating?</b></p>
    <p class="faq">Ratings provide a numeric reflection of the impact someone has over the course of a year, including goals achieved, successes, development areas, and challenges. By removing ratings, we've broadened the options for discussing performance.
    <br><br>
    Regular, rich conversations where we can share information means that we'll be aware of our performance against business goals -- regardless of whether it's assigned a number.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p class="faq"><b>How does compensation factor into performance?</b></p>
    <p class="faq">Performance and compensation should be separate conversations.
    <br><br>
    A meaningful conversation about performance should take place at the end of the year. That way, when Turner's annual numbers are finalized -- which is usually late in 1st quarter -- a follow-up conversation about compensation can take place.
    <br><br>
    A specific compensation process and timeline is finalized and shared with people leaders at the end of each year.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p class="faq"><b>How do I differentiate compensation for my high-performing staff?</b></p>
    <p class="faq">
    People leaders are afforded the flexibility to allocate rewards amongst their teams as long as they stay within the defined compensation budget.
    <br><br>
    More specific details about the compensation process and timeline are provided to people leaders at the end of each year.
